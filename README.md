# Architecture Weekly

Hi! My name is [Oskar Dudycz](https://github.com/oskardudycz). I created this repository to share a weekly set of links that I found valuable and inspiring. I hope that you'll like it! 

See also [Summary](Summary.md) of all links.

## Contributing

Feel free to add your links by sending PR with update to [Upcoming.md](https://github.com/oskardudycz/ArchitectureWeekly/edit/main/Upcoming.md) document. 

There are two rules:
- it has to be interesting, 
- we should not be adding links to our posts - this repository is not for advertising ourselves but sharing the knowledge.

## Support

💖 If this repository helped you - I'd be more than happy if you **join** the group of **my official supporters** at [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/oskardudycz)
